# Murlisgib
SourceMod Plugins for the Murlisgib Gamemode

## Project Paths
The root folder of the repository represents SourceMod's `scripting` directory.  
The `csgo` folder provides example configuration files and should be moved to the `csgo` directory of the dedicated server when installing the mod.

## Dependencies
Most of the Plugins require [smlib](https://github.com/bcserv/smlib/tree/transitional_syntax) to compile.
